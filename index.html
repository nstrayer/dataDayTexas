# Outline

Three sections

1. What...
2. Why...
3. How...

... I did

# What?

---
class: middle
# Made a shiny app for casting spells


&gt; Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

- Arthur C. Clark

Wave your phone around and 'cast' a spell.

# Three main steps:

1. Shiny app for gathering data
2. Modeling data with Keras
3. Shiny app for presenting data

# Why?

class: middle

&lt;img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nstrayer/shinysense_useR2017/master/screenshots/data_science_flow_goal.png" /&gt;

I want to show Shiny can fit into the datascience workflow from the begining to the end. 

Traditionally shiny has been used to show off results afterwards, but that's missing a huge portion of its potential.

# Shiny for gathering data

Who is better at knowing how they need data than the ones who are going to be using it?

&lt;img src = "http://www.michaelbunker.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/06/wheat8.jpg"/ height = 250&gt;
&lt;a href = "http://www.michaelbunker.com"/&gt;&lt;span size = 8&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
]


Many people like statisticians are given entire courses on how to set up things like clinical trials, but datascience doesn't always work like that.

# Shiny for presenting models

This is the traditional way shiny is used, but there's a reason for that. It's great. 

.center[
&lt;img src = "model_plot.svg" height = 250/&gt;
]

Instead of having to get fancy with learning how to port tensorflow models to Swift or Java you can just throw a predict function inside of a simple app. 

How well can this scale?

# Shiny

.pull-left[

&gt; Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.

# Requirement Analysis: 

We need to...

- Gather data from accelerometer
- Save data somewhere I could use it
- Visualize results so that I could make sure I wasn't recording bad data.

---
class: middle
#Gathering Data from accelerometer

Used my package `shinysense`. 

.center[
&lt;img src = 'shinysenseslim.png' height = 150 /&gt;
]


Contains functions to bring data into Shiny apps.

One of these data sources happens to be an accelerometer data.

# Movr 


.pull-left[
__ui.R__

```r
shinymovrUI("movr_button")
```
]
.pull-right[
__server.R__

```r
movement &lt;- callModule(
  shinymovr, 
  "movr_button")
```
]


Binds to the `devicemotion` api in javascript to pull in motion data.


```js
window.addEventListener("deviceorientation", handleMovementFunc);
```


.center[
&lt;div class="garden"&gt;
  &lt;div class="ball"&gt;It's alive!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

# Saving the data

Two options: 
1. Use shinyapps.io and do a dropbox or similar upload
2. Just host the app from my own server
    - This was easier.
    - Better for other reasons I will get to later as well.
    
Luckily the RStudio Server makes this crazy easy.


```r
write_csv(rvs$movements, paste0(sessionId, '_movement.csv'))
```


---
# Visualizing data 

Not that hard as `shinysense::movr` returns an observable that can be used like any other shiny object.

.pull-left[

```r
movement() %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = time, 
    y = accel
  )) +
  geom_line(aes(
    color = direction
  )) + ...
```

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src = 'visualized_app.png' height = 300/&gt;
]

Added a delete button if bad data was detected.

# Data exploration/ visualization

---
# Getting data all in

By saving all of the data to the hope repo as unique id `.csv`s all I have to do is read them in with a single `purrr` line. 


```r
# get the files in our directory
all_files &lt;- list.files('gather_data')
# just get the csvs
csv_names &lt;- all_files[grepl('.csv', all_files)]

# load all data into a dataframe
data &lt;- csv_names %&gt;% 
  map_df(read_csv)
```

By far the best thing about this whole project.

---
# Visualizing all data for trends




```r
ggplot(data, aes(x = time, y = accel, group = recording_id)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = direction), alpha = 0.15) + 
  facet_wrap(~label) +
  theme_void() + guides(color = FALSE) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(family = "Amatic SC", size = 18))
```

# Converting data to tensors

.pull-left[
Currently the largest sticking point in the R world for deep learning. (_opinion_)

We (R users) like to think flat and tidy, tensors do not.
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img style="margin-top:-55px" src = 'http://www.sunlab.org/teaching/cse6250/fall2017/lab/image/DL/tensor.png' height = 220/&gt;
]



```r
directions &lt;- c('m_x','m_y','m_z')
wide_data &lt;- data %&gt;% 
  # take data and make it wide. Et tu brutus?
  spread(direction, accel) %&gt;% 
  # group into each individual spell cast
  group_by(label, recording_id) %&gt;% 
  # convert each grouping into a list with a matrix inside.
  do( data = as.matrix(.[directions]) )
```

One-hot encoding is even more messy at this point.

# Building Keras model

&lt;p style='padding-bottom: 25px;'&gt;
When building a deep learning model you need to ask yourself three things
&lt;/p&gt;

.pull-left[
1. What architecture fits my problem/limitations best?
2. How do I stack my layers?
3. Couldn't KNN do this better?

# Architecture


.pull-left[
For sequential data there are two options, recurrent and convolutional. 

Reccurent are fantastic for learning time dependent patterns but are slow

Convolutional are great at recognizing patterns and are fast

Since I don't have a ton of compute and accelerometer data is often pattern recognized I chose a CNN

# R's Keras vs Python's

This is where R shines in deep learning. 

The pipe operator turns the sequential API into a much more readable format than in python.

.pull-left[
__R__

```r
model &lt;- keras_model_sequential()
model %&gt;% 
  layer_conv_1d(...) %&gt;%
  layer_batch_normalization() %&gt;% 
  layer_global_max_pooling_1d() %&gt;%
  layer_dropout(0.4) %&gt;% 
  layer_dense(
    num_classes, 
    activation = 'softmax'
  ) 
```
]
.pull-right[
__Python__

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(conv_1d(...))
model.add(batch_normalization)
model.add(global_max_pooling_1d)
model.add(dropout(0.4))
model.add(dense(
  num_classes,
  activation = 'softmax'
))
```
]

# Saving model for future use

&lt;style&gt;
.small_code {
  font-size: 0.85em;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

You can dump the keras model as its own file to be loaded up and instantly used later. 

.pull-left[
__Now__
.small_code[

```r
model %&gt;% 
  save_model_hdf5('model.h5')
```
]

]
.pull-right[
__Later__
.small_code[

```r
model &lt;- load_model_hdf5('model.h5')
```
]
]

While you technically could do this with any model using `saveRds` it's nice to have it be a first-class citizen.

# Final Shiny app

---
# Wire in Keras

You simply have to plop it in like any other package. 


```r
library(keras)
```


Make sure to turn off GPU mode! You don't need the speed.


```r
`use_session_with_seed(
  42, 
  disable_gpu = TRUE, 
  disable_parallel_cpu = FALSE
)
```


If running on a server that you use to train this can cause fun crashes due to memory access permissions.

# Testing it

.pull-left[
__Problem:__ 

_Need to test the app on a phone, but how to do that?_

]
.pull-right[
__Solution:__ 

_Use ShinyServer hosted on your own computer. _

]

&lt;div style = 'padding-top: 70px'&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
By hosting your own server this process is way faster.

Simply save your app's files and refresh your page and it's updated!

Massively speeds up the iteration process.

---
# Making it look pretty

_The most important part_

It's very easy to add some CSS to your app.


```r
tags$style(HTML("
@import url('//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Amatic+SC|Josefin+Slab');
h2, h3, button {
  font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive;
}
h2 {
  font-size: 50px;
}
p {
  font-family: 'Josefin Slab', cursive;
  font-size: 18px;
}
button {
  font-size: 28px;
}"))
```

# Deploying it

Do we want to kill our server? 

.pull-left[
__Yes__

Leave it on personal server.
]
.pull-right[
__No__

Send it to shinyapps.io
]


&lt;div style='text-align: center; padding-top: 65px'&gt;

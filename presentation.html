# Outline

Three sections

1. What...
2. Why...
3. How...

... I did

# What?

---

# Made a shiny app for casting spells

---

# Three main steps:

1. Shiny app for gathering data
2. Modeling data with Keras
3. Shiny app for presenting data

# Demo

# Why?

---

I want to show Shiny can fit into the datascience workflow from the begining to the end. 

Traditionally shiny has been used to show off results afterwards, but that's missing a huge portion of its potential.

# Shiny for gathering data

Who is better at knowing how they need data than the ones who are going to be using it?

Many people like statisticians are given entire courses on how to set up things like clinical trials, but datascience doesn't always work like that.

# Shiny for presenting models

This is the traditional way shiny is used, but there's a reason for that. It's great. 

Instead of having to get fancy with learning how to port tensorflow models to Swift or Java you can just throw a predict function inside of a simple app. 

How well can this scale?

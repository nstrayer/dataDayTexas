ÿMaking Magic With Shiny and Keras
	What it is I have done
		Made a shiny app for gathering data for modeling
		Trained a deep neural network on gathered data
		Built another shiny app to use that model
	Why I did it
		Want to show how shiny/ application development can fit into all aspects of the datascience process
			Shiny app was used at the first stage to gather data
				This takes statisticians back to what they are good at: setting up data collection.
			Visualization was used both in the data gathering step and modeling step
				For data gathering it served as quality control
				For modeling it served to make initial assessments of model feasability
			Shiny app was used again to demo or deploy model
	How I did it
		Shiny
			Framework that allows rapid prototyping of apps onto mobile devices
			Own instance of shinyserver
				Vastly speeds up the development process over sending to shinyapps.io
		Shinysense
			My own library for giving Shiny apps the ability to 'sense' the world around them
			In this case I used the function movr
				Movr places a button in your app that lets you gather data from the accelerometer in your phone or tilt from your laptop
			Other functions could be combined into more complex applications.
				seer would be able to do photo recognition (bandwidth issues may be difficult)
				You could train a gesture recognition system for adding data to an app with drawr or movr...
		Keras
			Deep learning framework that makes it terrifyingly easy to build deep neural networks
			Used 1-d convolutional neural network
				These convolutions turn something that is very high dimensional and reduces the dimensions greatly allowing for effective modeling
				Convolutional filters act as feature detectors finding things like an upward flick
				Could have used an RNN but sensor data in this context (short single class instances) lend themselves much better to CNNs
					Trained way way faster(10x) allowing for more hyperparameter experimentation.
